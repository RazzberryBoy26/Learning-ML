# Overview:
This was more of a playful session, wherein I explored the numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries and their capabilities. Just did random plottings and made a cool convergent orbit graph.

# What I learned:
1. How datasets are essentially stored in the memory(tabular form).
2. Many commands, methods and functions that can be used to perform operations on the data of a particular dataset.
3. What are mandelbrot sets, and how fractals differ (just some random math :p).
4. Matrix manipulation, and other numpy operations.
