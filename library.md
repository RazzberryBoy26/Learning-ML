# Overview:
This was more of a playful session, wherein I explored the numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries and their capabilities. Just did random plottings and made a cool convergent orbit graph. Learning the commands and methods of these libraries is crucial, hence this was a much-needed practice.

# What I learned:
1. How datasets are essentially stored in the memory(tabular form). Naming columns and rows, how to fetch data, everything like that is done by pandas.
2. Many commands, methods and functions that can be used to perform operations on the data of a particular dataset. How a particular column or row in what form of matrix or array form, also done using pandas library.
3. Also learned commands for adjusting the size of a graph, the trajectories, the scaling and the scatterplot plotting. Also learned to adjust the colours of the points and their size. Basically all the visual attributes. It was done using matplotlib. Mainly chatgpt helped for this. 
4. For the complex sequence plotting, at first I thought I would have to handle the real and imaginary parts separately using 2 different arrays and 2 different sequences for each (which would ultimately derive our main complex sequence). However, python allows complex numbers as direct data types, which made the mathematical work much easier (work of deriving the equations of the sequence for the real and imaginary part separately was nullified).
5. What are mandelbrot sets, and how fractals differ from them.

Thank you for sticking around :))
