# 3rd Week!
## Aims for the week:
1. Learn and implement the perceptron model for classification problems. (ongoing)
2. Learn and implement GLM using Bernoulli model for logistic regression. (ongoing)
   **NOTE: THE IMPLEMENTATION FOR SIMPLE GRADIENT ASCENT AND GLM FOR LOGISTIC REGRESSION USE THE SAME CONCEPTS. SO THEY WILL BE PRETTY SIMILAR.**
3. Learn and implement GLM using Cross-Entropy model for softmax regression. (ongoing)
4. I will try to finish atleast 2 lectures of Convex optimisation this week. If time allows, I will also try to explain in detail in an ipynb file, about what I've learned.

Here we go :p
