# 1st Week!
## Aims for the week:
1. Learn and implement (and explore) Batch Gradient Descent for Linear regression. (completed)
  --> My code implementation at: [https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-1/bgd.ipynb]
  --> My mistakes, what I learned: [https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-1/my_experience.md]
2. Learn and implement (and explore) Stochastic Gradient Descent for Linear regression. (completed)
  --> My code implementation at: [https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-1/sgd1.ipynb]
  --> My mistakes, what I learned: [https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-1/stochastic_gd.md]
4. Learn and implement (and explore) the Normal Equations for Linear Regression. (ongoing)
5. Play around a bit with the python libraries. (completed)
  --> My code implementation at: [https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-1/plotting1.ipynb] , [https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-1/convergence.ipynb]
  --> My mistakes, what I learned: [https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-1/library.md]
Here we go :p
