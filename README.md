# 2nd Week!
## Aims for the week:
1. Learn and implement (and explore) locally weighted regression. (completed, checkout the code at --> https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-2/locally_weighted_regression.ipynb and my own experience at --> https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-2/locally_weighted_implementation.ipynb)
2. Learn and implement (and explore) Newton's method for logistic regression. (ongoing)
3. Implement the algorithm for bounding the convergence value for theta vector via batch gradient descent. (partially completed, view the intuition behind algorithm at https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-2/convergent_bound_bgd.ipynb)

Here we go :p

Um guys. Sorry I wasn't able to upload much last week. There was a family emergency and I was busy travelling due to that. Will upload everything this week itself!
