# 2nd Week!
## Aims for the week:
1. Learn and implement (and explore) the perceptron model for Logistic regression. (ongoing)
2. Learn and implement (and explore) locally weighted regression. (ongoing)
3. Learn and implement (and explore) Newton's method for logistic regression. (ongoing)
4. Implement the algorithm for bounding the convergence value for theta vector via batch gradient descent. (partially completed, view the intuition behind algorithm at [])

Here we go :p
