# Overview (of what I'll be doing here)
I'll be tracking my Machine Learning journey. I'll explain what I've learnt in a terse manner - the math, the code and how it all relates with the intuition behind it. This is pretty much in the description so nothing much to read.
# Some resources I am using
1. Andrew Ng's Cs-229 Stanford course playlist (on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwO_UgTS7I&list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU)
2. 3B1B playlist - Machine Learning (on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
   P.S. I have selected what resources I thought were best for me as a beginner, but with a fairly strong mathematical background. Please feel free to suggest any other     resources as well!
3. Datasets from ScikitLearn and Kaggle.

Thaaat's pretty much it :)
