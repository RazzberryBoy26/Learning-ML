# 4th week!
## Aims for the week:
1. Learn and implement GDA and Naive Bayes' algorithm (ongoing).
2. Review and revise all the previous algorithms + explore (https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-4/glm_poisson.ipynb, still ongoing).
3. Write in detail in an ipynb file, on what I've learned in convex optimisation up till now. (ongoing)

Here we go :p
