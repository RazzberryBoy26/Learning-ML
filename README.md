# Some resources I am using:
1. Andrew Ng's Cs-229 Stanford course playlist (on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwO_UgTS7I&list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU)
2. 3B1B playlist - Machine Learning (on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
   P.S. I have selected what resources I thought were best for me as a beginner, but with a fairly strong mathematical background. Please feel free to suggest any other resources as well at (https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/issues/1)
3. Datasets from ScikitLearn and Kaggle.
4. ChatGPT (for doubt clarification, etc.)
