--> My code implementation at: [https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-1/bgd.ipynb]
--> My mistakes, what I learned: [https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-1/my_experience.md]
2. Learn and implement (and explore) Stochastic Gradient Descent for Linear regression. (completed)
--> My code implementation at: [https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-1/sgd1.ipynb]
--> My mistakes, what I learned: [https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-1/stochastic_gd.md]
4. Learn and implement (and explore) the Normal Equations for Linear Regression. (completed)
--> My code implementation at: [https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-1/bgd_california_housing.ipynb], [https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-1/sgd_bgd_california_housing.ipynb], [https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-1/bgd_diabetes.ipynb], [https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-1/sgd_bgd_diabetes.ipynb]
