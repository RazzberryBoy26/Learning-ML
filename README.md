# 3rd Week!
## Aims for the week:
1. Learn and implement the perceptron model for classification problems. (https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-3/Perceptron_implementation.ipynb)
2. Learn and implement GLM using Cross-Entropy model for softmax regression. (https://github.com/RazzberryBoy26/Learning-ML/blob/Week-3/Softmax_multiclass_implementation.ipynb)
3. I will try to finish atleast 1 lecture of Convex optimisation this week. If time allows, I will also try to explain in detail in an ipynb file, about what I've learned.

Here we go :p
Hello guys, the implementations of next week will also comprise of my Convex Optimisation file. Another lecture will be completed by then.
