    "# Overview\n",
    "I would like to share my own implementation for the perceptron model. I made a few mistakes along the way, which actually stemmed into a few ideas I would love to implement. The demonstration displays how the perceptron classifies binary results for two datasets: the breast_cancer toy dataset available from the scikit learn libraries; and a custom binary dataset to show how Perceptron model works on these sets.\n",
    "# Mistakes, doubts, ideas:\n",
    "1. Why do we need the biasing term for calculation of $Z^{i} = X^{i} \\theta$? What will be the effect on the decision boundary if I don't take it? (Found that the decision boundary will always pass through the origin no matter what, which flaws our accuracy on the algorithm).\n",
    "2. Learned a new vectorized operation to convert the $X_{i} \\theta$ into our main Hypothesis matrix.\n",
    "3. Had flipped the sign of $Y^{i}$ and $H_{\\theta}(X^{i})$, which earlier gave trash accuracies.\n",
    "4. Had assumed {0, 1} range space to be applied on the perceptron model. Changed that to {-1, 1} as the generic convention.\n",
    "5. In logistic regression, we use the log-likelihood function to maximise accuracy based on a probabilistic interpretation. Can we use our basic accuracy matrix to determine a rule for the updation? Will try this in the future.\n",
